    <h1>Manchester City comeback after shaky first half</h1>
        <p>Manchester City showed up to matchday with not much to play for as they were already qualified for the next round but as they narrowly avoid their first defeat in European Competition on their home ground since 2018, it raises concern on their form and what the future will bring for the current European Champions.
        Lois Openda scored both Leipzig goals in the first half after big blunders from City's defensive line. This raises a huge concern for the backline as they have conceded seven goals in the last three games.
        After one of City's most underwhelming recent first half performances, Erling Haaland scores to start the comeback. Phil Foden followed to scored the second netter and Julian Alvarez closing it out for Manchester City to secure the first spot in the group.<p>
