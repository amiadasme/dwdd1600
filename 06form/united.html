    <h1>Manchester United throw away lead and are at risk of being eliminated</h1>
        <p>With Bayern Munich already qualified to the round of 16 and the runner up spot still up for grabs, this was predicted to be an intense game and it definitely was. Manchester United ended in a thrilling draw with the Turkish team Galatasaray. 
        United's Garnacho and Fernandes gave them an early two-goal lead and McTominay cementing the lead by minute 55' the English side seemed to be in a pretty safe spot. However, Ziyech put a goal past Onana and Akturkoglu equalised at the 71' minute. There were many shots tried in the dying minutes as they both looked to seal the game in glory, including a good effort from Fernandes that went off the post. The hair-raising game ended 3-3 leaving things open for the last <a href="schedule.html#groupa">matchday</a>
